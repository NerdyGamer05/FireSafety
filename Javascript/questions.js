  question: "What is the biggest reason that Electric Vehicles (EV) are the hardest vehicle fires to extinguish?",
  answer: "The stored energy in lithium batteries act as a massive fuel source",
  options: randomizeq([
    "The way EVâ€™s are built allows the fire to hide inside the car making it hard to reach",
    "The stored energy in lithium batteries act as a massive fuel source",
    "EVs are still new and dont have the same safety measures as gas cars",
    "They are actually the easiest to extinguish"
  ]),
    explanation: `<p class="explanationText">Lithium-ion battery fires can reach more than 3000 degrees fahrenheit whereas gas fires only reach about 1500 degrees fahrenheit. Since lithium-ion batteries act as their own fuel source firefighters usually have to put out the fire multiple times before the batteries stop reigniting. Even then, Lithium ion batteries can reignite hours or even days after</p>`
